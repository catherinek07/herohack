Hello, this is Frank Li, Caleb Ji, and Catherine Kim, and our website for HeroHacks II called iNFiniTe, a website that turns motivational quotes and their images into NFTs that empowers people as they create, share, sell, and buy meaningful words and beautiful pictures.

Everyday, our world falls deeper and deeper into unmotivated depression, also known as burnout :(. As society develops, the individual falls between the cracks in the foundation and is left to fend for themselves within the constantly growing anxiety about keeping up. How so, therefore, should a mere individual like you or me, ever hope to overcome the hardships and strive for betterment? Well, one way we wish to tackle this issue is through constant motivation from both ourselves and others.

It has been proven through many scientific studies that motivational quotes offer a pathway to a rejuvenated spirit. Once mixed with beauty for a background and calligraphic font, these motivational quotes turn into more than just mere words on a screen, but lifelines for the struggling. 

That is why we wish to provide the easiest way to create these quotes of motivation. However, such pieces of art can only be thought of as the best of the best, and the best are only prized when they are worth value. Thus, to bring to the worldâ€™s eyes the worth of personally created motivational quotes, we added the feature of automatically turning them into NFTs. 

NFTs have been a worldwide phenomenon, gaining internet traction and investments from multi-millionaires. It is truly the future of money making and the buying and selling of valuable items. 

To create the website, we utilized HTML/CSS and Javascript, specifically using libraries such React.js to enhance the visual elements and functionality of our website. Moreover, we used API DeSo to establish our NFTs. 

Here in our web application, a user can log into their deso blockchain account that they will be posting the NFTs from. 

To create their NFT, all they must do is click the create button, type in their quote, then click submit.

Through this, we hope empowerment can truly be achieved, Empowerment coming from the many who will stumble upon these NFTs and buy them as they are inspired by them, and empowerment from the sellers of the nft who can make some money and gain confidence by inspiring others. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
